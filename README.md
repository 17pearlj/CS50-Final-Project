Video - https://youtu.be/aOzz1BTKcOU

## Introduction-


SpoonTune is a lightweight melody generation app built on a flask server. It is designed for a musician to be able to
input a set of paramaters, and recieve back a radomly generated melody. If the user likes the melody, they can download
it in either a .wav format or .midi format. The former is better for composers, while the latter is more useful for music
producers working in a DAW (such as Garageband of Fruityloops). The website allows for users to create an account, with
which they can save their favorite presets.
